/*

Everything in JS happens inside an execution context.
An execution context has two components - 1.Memory Component(Variable Environment) 2.Code Component(Thread In Execution).
Execution takes place in two phases - 1.Memory allocation phase 2.Code execution phase

JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language
Synchronous - Execution happens in a specific order. Cannot jump from one part of code to another
Single-threaded - Single line is executed at a time
